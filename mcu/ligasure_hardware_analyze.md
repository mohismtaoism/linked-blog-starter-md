## Power Module

The system uses 5V input, filtered by EMI filters. Isolated DC-DC converters (URB2405S, B0505S)
provide isolated power rails, followed by AMS1117-3.3 LDO regulators to supply 3.3V for MCUs.
Each MCU has its own isolated power domain.

## MCU Core

Two STM32F405RGT6 MCUs are used, likely one for main control logic and one for safety
monitoring or redundancy. Each MCU has external crystal oscillators and proper decoupling
according to the reference design.

## Communication & Isolation

Digital isolators (ISO7220ADR, ISO7221BDR) isolate UART communication channels. High-speed
optocouplers (6N137) provide signal isolation to protect the control core from external noise.

## External Interfaces

Multiple UART ports (UART1, UART2, UART5, USART6) allow communication with external
devices. SPI interface is connected to the onboard EEPROM.

## Driver & Relay Module

Relay drivers switch external loads. The NS8002 amplifier drives a buzzer for audible alarms or
feedback signals.

## Data Storage

CAT25256 SPI EEPROM is used to store device parameters and logs, supporting easy firmware
upgrades and data persistence.

## Description

## **1. Power and Clock**

- **VDD / VDDA:** Connected to the 3.3V power rail, with multiple decoupling capacitors for noise suppression.
    
- **VDDA:** Filtered by a ferrite bead and used as the analog power reference for ADC.
    
- **VCAP1 / VCAP2:** Each connected to a 2.2 ÂµF capacitor to stabilize the internal voltage regulator.
    
- **HSE Clock:** External 8 MHz crystal oscillator with two 22 pF capacitors to GND for precise timing.
    
## **2. Reset and Boot**

- **NRST:** Connected to a pull-up resistor and external reset circuit (watchdog / manual reset button).
    
- **BOOT0:** Pulled down to GND, selecting boot from internal flash memory.
    
## **3. Communication Interfaces**

- **UART1 (PA9/PA10):** Connected to an external connector, typically used for host communication or debugging.
    
- **UART6 (PC6/PC7/PC8/PC9):** Routed through digital isolators (ISO7220/7221) to provide galvanically isolated communication.
    
- **SPI (MISO/MOSI/SCK/CS):** Connected to CAT25256 EEPROM for parameter storage and logging.
    
## **4. Control Outputs**

- **PWM Outputs (PA0, PA1, PA2):** Drive relay circuits and the NS8002 amplifier for buzzer/alarm control.
    
- **Digital Outputs:** May control status LEDs or other driver circuits.
    
## **5. Digital Inputs**

- **GPIO Inputs:** Connected to optocoupler outputs, allowing isolated detection of external events (e.g., sensors, triggers).
